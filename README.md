I had an issue with my border radius not applying to my buttons for some reason and could not figure out how to place the button in the top section below the logo.  I had created a Div which worked until I applied CSS.

I used this link to figure out how to make certain text elements red:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4622808/html-changing-colors-of-specific-words-in-a-string-of-text.
